    "Classification : Classification is identifying a category to which a new observation belongs to, on the basis of a past observations. A classifier can predict a group/category to which an observation belongs to. The output is discrete/categorical value. A simple example for a classification would be finding if an animal is herbivorous or omnivorous or carnivorous given list of food it ate during the period of 10 days.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machine (SVM):\n",
    "\n",
    "   SVM techniques work the best when the data provided is linearly seperable. With the help of kernel functions in some cases SVM could also deal with non lineraly seperable data.[6,7] \n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world applications:** \n",
    "\n",
    "***Cancer detection: ***\n",
    "\n",
    "   Breast cancer classification is an area of active research. Several researchers are using different kinds of data to classify if the tumor is benign or malignant [1,2]. In [1] authors discuss about using non invasive imaging techniques and SVM to classify tumor with an accuracy of 88.10%, sensitivity and specificity of 85.71% and 90.48% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Oil and Gas industry:***\n",
    "\n",
    "   Several publications are available on proposed usage of SVM's in Oil and Gas industry[3,4,5]. Exploration of oil and gas is one such problem in which SVM's can be used. Exploration is the term used in the oil and gas industry to designate the search and recognition of structural or stratigraphic traps where hydrocarbons may have accumulated [3]. \n",
    "In [5] use of SVM to predict the distribution of hydrocarbons in a reservoir is discussed. In [4] the authors discuss about predicting (probably SVR's) porosity and permeability two important petrophysical properties which relate to amount of fluid in the proposed reservoir and their ability to flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- SVM work very well when there is clear margin of seperation. Kernal functions can be used for non linearly seperable data\n",
    "- SVM is memory efficient as it uses a small subset of training set in decision function\n",
    "- Effective with high dimentional data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dis-advantages:**\n",
    "- Training time is cubic in size of the dataset. So very slow when datasets are huge.\n",
    "- Doesn't work well in the presence of noise generally prone to overfitting to the noise.\n",
    "- SVM's do not provide probability estimates \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** \n",
    "SVM's are better to be used with smaller datasets considering such as the dataset for this project their training time. The classification is memory efficient. Considering the number of features this problem is a multi dimentional classification problem and SVM's can be used for multi dimentional classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):\n",
    "Stochastic gradient Descent is an optimazation method used in machine learning algorithms. SVM's, Linear regression classifiers can be trained using stochastic gradient method. Scikit-learn implementation of SGD is inspired from Stochastic Gradient SVM of Léon Bottou [8,9]. So SGD classifier has advantages of SVM along with improved efficency. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world applications:** \n",
    "SGD's are used for training neural networks, deep learning networks, SVM's, linear regressors. SGD along with appropriate alogirthms can be used for solving classifcation or regression problems in different fields. Deep learning techniques can be used in facial recognition, image recognition, textual analysis, speech recogntion and many more applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Advantages of SVM\n",
    "- Computationally efficient in terms of training, which is basically linear with number of training examples. Computationally efficient beacuase, during training phase SGD uses a subset of training set instead of using entire training set to update its weights at each epoch.  \n",
    "- Ease of implementation. There are lots of opportunities for code tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dis-advantages:**\n",
    "- Has a number of hyper-parameters\n",
    "- SGD is sensitive for feature scaling\n",
    "- prone to overfitting to the noise.\n",
    "- do not provide probability estimates \n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** \n",
    "Considering the implentation of SGD in Scikit-learn I expect the results to be similar to SVM with improved efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adaboost\n",
    "The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction [10,11]. Can use with data that is textual, numeric, discrete, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world applications:** \n",
    "In [12] authors describe using ada boost algorithm for detection of basketball player from image frames. In the publication the authors describe speed is the reason why they choose adaboost but it didnot perform well. They suggested using Adaboost with some other method to classify the false positives of ada boost predictions to increase overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Ease of implementation\n",
    "- less parameters to tune \n",
    "- flexible — can combine with any learning algorithm\n",
    "- In some problems it can be less prone to over fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dis-advantages:**\n",
    "- AdaBoost classifier is combination many  weak learners and inaccurate classifiers, so the overall performace depends on performances of each learner/classifier.[13]\n",
    "- suceptable to noise \n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** \n",
    "Several weak learners contribute towards final predication in Adaboost. The prediction can be a bit memory intensive and slow but due to aggregated result from weak classifiers I expect it to have better accuracy in prediction.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

    "Support Vector Machine's are around for a long time and are being used in many real world applications. There are tons of publications around applications of SVM's. SVM classifier is apt for classifying data with clear margin of seperation. SVM classifier is simple algorithm. During training phase SVM's calculate boundary of seperation dividing similar types of data instances from a given dataset. During prediction phase the side of boundary to which a data instance belongs to determines its class.\n",

    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of points which are lineraly seperable can be seperated by one or more hyperplanes as shown in figure below. These hyperplanes can be found using a technique called quadratic programming.\n",
    "\n",

    "<center>Lots of possible hyperplanes for given set of points</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM's enables us finding optimal hyper plane which can be used for defining the decision function. Support vectors are the elements of the training set that would change the position of the dividing hyper plane if removed or moved. Support vectors lie on hyperplanes H1 and H2 as shown in the figure. The distance between two hyper planes H1 and H2 is called margin. SVM finds hyper planes H1 and H2 which have biggest margin possible for given set of data and finally calculates the optimal hyper plane which will be exaclty in the middle of H1 and H2. During prediction phase the side of optimal hyperplane to which a data instance belongs to determines its class.[1]\n",

    "\n",
    "To use SVM's with non linearly seperable data we can use kernal trick. The figure belows shows an example of kernal trick. In this example the kernel function transformed the given set of points to another space in which the points are linearly seperable. The function used for tranformantion is called kernel function. The kernel function used in the example is Radial basis fucntion (RBF). RBF, polynomial and sigmoidal kernels are some of the most used kernels.\n",

    "SVM's are memory efficient as it stores a small subset of training set (Support vectors) to make a prediction. It is effective even with datasets containing high number of features. It works well even if less number of data samples are provided as training set. In this project the size of dataset is less and there are many features, so this model is appropriate.\n",
